    "**Calculation of Heat Flow for Radiators**\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the heat flow of a radiator under conditions different from normal (95/85/20°C, coolant flow rate 0.1 kg/s) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q = Q_{\\text{nom}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{70}\\right)^n \\cdot b \\cdot k \\cdot p$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $Q_{\\text{nom}}$ is the nominal heat flow of the radiator under normal conditions [W].\n",
    "- $\\theta$ is the actual temperature difference [°C].\n",
    "- $t_h$ and $t_k$ are the initial and final temperatures of the coolant (at the inlet and outlet) in the heating device [°C].\n",
    "- $t_p$ is the calculated room temperature, equal to the calculated air temperature in the heated room [°C].\n",
    "- $n$ is an empirical exponent for the relative temperature difference.\n",
    "- $b$ is a dimensionless correction factor for the calculated atmospheric pressure.\n",
    "- $k$ is the coefficient for single-sided connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a coolant flow rate of 0.015–0.15 kg/s (54–540 kg/h), the coefficients are $c = 1$, $m = 0$, $p = 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q = Q_{\\text{nom}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{70}\\right)^n \\cdot b \\cdot k$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Movement of Coolant:**\n",
    "- For \"top-down\" movement, the coefficients are as follows:\n",
    "  - $n = 0.26$ for 10–300, 10–500, and 11–500.\n",
    "  - $n = 0.3$ for 20–300 and 20–500.\n",
    "  - $n = 0.28$ for 20–200, 202–300, and 202–500.\n",
    "  - $n = 0.3$ for 21–300, 21–500, 22–300, and 22–500.\n",
